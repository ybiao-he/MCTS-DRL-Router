# circuit routing using MCTS with DRL policy

To train RL for a board, just run `python3 main_mcts.py directory_to_board board_name folder_to_policy_model`. For example, to train for board `board_II4`, the one in currecnt forlder, please run `python3 main.py ./ board_II32.csv circuit_routing/MCTS_DRL_simple_version/PPO_routing/results_env0_board_II32.csv/`.
